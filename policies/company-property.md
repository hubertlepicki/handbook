## Care of Company Property

You are expected to demonstrate proper care when using the company's property and equipment. No property may be removed from the premises without the proper authorization of management. If you lose, break or damage any property, report it to your supervisor at once. In the event of loss or damage, you may be held financially liable.

Company property may include laptop and desktop computers, peripherals, cell phones, telephones, printers, scanners, fax machines, office keys/alarm codes and intellectual property.

All company property dispensed to our employees becomes the responsibility of the employee. If the employee's employment is terminated or if the company requests that the property be returned for any reason, then the employee has 7 calendar days to return the equipment in good condition. If the property is not returned, the company may take action to recover its losses, up to and including legal action.

## Intellectual Property

All software, concepts, development and completed projects are the property of the company or our clients.
