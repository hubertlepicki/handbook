# Benefits: Employee Referral Bonus

The company will pay a $5,000 referral bonus to any employee who refers an applicant to our company who is hired by the company to a full-time position.

The bonus is paid upon completion of the newly hired employee's first 90 days of employment. The referring employee must still be employed with the company at the time the bonus is to be given.

Referrals to an apprenticeship are not eligible for the referral bonus.

Referrals to an apprenticeship who are eventually hired by thoughtbot or another company who pays the standard placement fee, are eligible for a $1,000 referral bonus.

## Eligibility

All employees of thoughtbot, including apprentices, are eligible for this benefit.
