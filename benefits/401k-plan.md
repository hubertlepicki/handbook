# 401(k) Plan

Our company provides eligible employees with a 401(k) Qualified Retirement plan to assist with long-term savings for retirement.

## 401(k) Company match

We match 100% of the first 3% contributed by an employee.  We match 50% each of the 4th and 5th percentile.  We do not do any matching on contributions beyond 5%.  Matching contributions are calculated on a per-payroll basis.

Employees are eligible after 3 months of employment, and we do 100% immediate vesting.
