# Health Insurance

## Questions

If you have questions regarding your health insurance, please email [benefits@thoughtbot.com][benefits-email].

## Eligibility

Eligible full-time employees will be enrolled in the health plan immediately upon starting with thoughtbot. Apprentices are not eligible for Health Insurance. Apprentices who are promoted to Developer or Designer become eligible on the first day of their new position.

## Medical Insurance

We pay 100% of the medical insurance premiums for both families and individuals.

We are able to provide a deductible of $500 for individuals and $1000 for families by using a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) administered by Choice Strategies. 

To pay a health care provider for service, you should present them with your BCBS Insurance Card and personally pay the appropriate co-pay amount for the service. When you go for service, it will be helpful for you to know what the co-pay is. You can find a list of all the co-pay amounts in the [benefits dropbox folder][benefits-forms].

The provider will bill BCBS for the cost of service beyond the co-pay, and BCBS will cover those charges.

You will be billed later by the provider for any costs which fall under your deductible amount.  BCBS will bill Choice Strategies for any costs which are above your deductible amount, and covered by the HRA.  You should receive notification of all billing, both before and after you've hit your deductible, for your records.

There may be times where a physician asks for payment up-front for a surgery or other procedure.  This is not how the plan is intended to work, and should not happen. If this does happen, do not pay more than your co-pay amount, and email [benefits@thoughtbot.com][benefits-email] who can help sort things out. We will have Choice Strategies contact the physician's office to explain their process.

You should never have to pay out of pocket and then be reimbursed.

## Find a Doctor, Review Benefits, Change your PCP

It's easy to find a doctor, review your benefits or charges, and change your PCP on BCBS website.  [Log-in or create a BCBS account][bcbs-website].

## Flexible Spending Account

We provide access to a [Flexible Spending Account][fsa-wikipedia] - which allows you to put aside up to $2,500 per year, pre-tax, which can be used to pay for eligible medical expenses.  In past years any unused amount would be "lost" when the plan year reset.  Starting in 2013, the IRS now allows up to $500 to rollover to the next plan year.

You receive a Visa Debit card from Choice Strategies for using the FSA funds. This is the same card that you use for other benefits from Choice Strategies like parking, mass transit, and DCA.  Your account will show the full balance of your elected yearly contribution immediately, and this amount can be used to pay for expenses immediately.  The account will be funded in even payroll withdrawals throughout the year.

## Choice Strategies Balance & Claims

You can check the balance of your choice strategies accounts (FSA, HRA, Parking & Transit) and file claims if you paid out of pocket on the Choice Strategies website.

Eligible expenses include custodial care of dependents while employee is at work. The maximum contribution per household is $5,000 if you are single, or you are married and filing a joint tax return, or $2,500 if you are married, filing separate tax returns.

You receive a Visa Debit card from Choice Strategies for using the DCA funds. This is the same card that you use for other benefits from Choice Strategies like parking, mass transit, and FSA.
