# Conferences

The company will pay 50% of all expenses for approved job-related conferences and seminars.  If you're speaking at the conference, we'll pay 100% of the expenses.

To get approval to attend a conference, email your local manager and the company CMO (Dan Croak).  In your request, provide as much detail as possible about the dates of the conference, your total expected out of office time, the costs of attending, the benefits expected to be gained by attending, any potential disruption to client work, etc.  They will reply as soon as possible.

## Eligibility

Eligible full-time employees can take advantage of this benefit upon starting with thoughtbot.

Apprentices are generally not eligible for this benefit unless they are invited to speak at a conference as a representative from thoughtbot. Also, apprentices who are promoted to Developer or Designer become eligible on the first day of their new position.

## Sign-up

Please sign-up to attend conferences on the appropriate conference spreadsheet, as prompted by your office manager or other conference attendance organizer.

Your office manager will book your travel & purchase your ticket.

If you are signing-up for a conference that sells out quickly, please purchase the ticket yourself on your company card, email the receipt to reimbursements & note on the sign-up spreadsheet that the ticket has already been purchased.

## Expenses while at the conference

Use your company card for meals & transportation while at the conference. Then email all the receipts to reimbursements@thoughtbot.com so that the 50% you owe can be deducted from your paycheck. Please write the names of any other people included in the purchase on the receipt.
